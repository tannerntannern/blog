After many years of learning benefiting from the online writing of others, I have finally decided to start my own blog. I do this both to give back to the community that helped me learn and grow as a software engineer, and to give myself a platform to share my thoughts and experiences. I do not know what the future holds for this platform. It could be filled with helpful articles on programming, as I originally planned. It could instead cover a broader range of topics, such as music or other things I find interesting. It also could very well not go anywhere because, being a fairly private person, I’m not eager to have a large presence online. I suppose you’ll just have to wait and see! For now, you can check out my main website: https://tannernielsen.com","link":"/2019/01/20/New-Blog-Introduction/"}],"tags":[{"name":"miscellaneous","slug":"miscellaneous","link":"/tags/miscellaneous/"}],"categories":[]}
