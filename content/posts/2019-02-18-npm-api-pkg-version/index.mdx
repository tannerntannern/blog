The official npm API provides a simple way to programmatically retrieve the latest version of any package, along with other metadata you might find in the `package.json`.  This has a variety of use cases, such as checking when a package is out of date, to name one example.  Today I'll demonstrate how to get the latest version of a package with only a few lines of code.  However, I was frustrated with what I found in other solutions, so I also want to talk about those and why you shouldn't use them.

A very popular way to get the latest version is through the [latest-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest-version) package on npm, which has nearly [3 million weekly downloads](https://www.npmtrends.com/latest-version).  The package sports a shiny ![build passing](https://badgen.net/badge/build/passing/green) badge (so you know it's good), and the README even tells you why you should choose this package over the [latest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest) package, which has "massive" dependencies.  The code example also looks pretty slick:

```javascript
console.log(await latestVersion('ava'));
//=> '0.18.0'
```

So my first impression is that the package is popular, reliable, more lightweight than the competition, and simple to use.  Sounds great to me!  Let's just [check the download size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=latest-version) before installing...

Wait a minute... This package literally exposes _one_ function that does _one_ thing.  How on earth could it possibly require nearly 90kB, _minified?!_  It turns out that the culprit is the package's only (and much more useful) dependency, [package-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package-json), which allows you to extract information from any `package.json` file on npm.

The crime here (in my opinion) is that this dependency is over-qualified;  **it feels a lot like cracking an egg with a hammer.**  Moreover, _the hammer itself_ is overkill, as the npm API already provides this information.  We can do better:

## A Better Solution
Using the npm API and the [much lighter-weight](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=axios@0.18.0) dependency, [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), we can rewrite the entire `latest-version` module in a handful of lines:

```javascript
function latestVersion(packageName) {
    return axios
        .get('https://registry.npmjs.org/' + packageName + '/latest')
        .then(res => res.data.version);
}
```

Just like the original package, `latestVersion()` returns a promise, so you can use it exactly the same as the `latest-version` docs describe:

```javascript
const packageVersion = await latestVersion('some-package');
```

## Conclusion
I hope this saved you some unnecessary code bloat.  If you want to see how other packages will affect your bundle size in the future, you can check for yourself at [bundlephobia.com](https://bundlephobia.com).
