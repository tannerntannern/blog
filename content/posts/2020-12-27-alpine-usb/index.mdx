Bootable USBs are useful to have around and relatively easy to make.  Some USBs are "live," meaning they are a clean slate every time you boot in, and others have "persistence," meaning changes you make will remain when you boot in next time.  [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) is a useful tool for creating both kinds of these USBs.  However, if you want persistence on less common Linux distributions, [Rufus may not be able to help you](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/1570).

While you _can_ add persistence to a live USB after it has been created, it requires lots of futzing in a terminal and may be too daunting of a task for non-linux-experts (myself included).  In this article I'll show you a simpler way to make a persistent Alpine Linux bootable USB.

# Prerequisites
* Familiarity with terminal interfaces and common Linux commands
* A Windows machine
* 2 USB drives
	- One will serve as our persistent bootable USB
	- The other will be a temporary live USB used to install Alpine Linux onto the first USB
	- Not mandatory, but it will be helpful if the 2 USBs have different storage capacities (makes it easier to distinguish between them in the terminal)

# Preparing the Drives
